Notes
=====

Source tarball
--------------
Source releases are in .tar.gz files unpack to evolvotron/ directory.

- Note that the configure file provided is not autotools
  based, but is a script invoking qmake.

- See the evolvotron/README file build re dependencies and 
  setup of QTDIR environment 

Debian-world packages
---------------------
Prebuilt .deb packages for a variety of systems are created
to sanity-check packaging feasibility (currently using the "yada"
tool).  These are provided as they may be useful to some, but most
users should prefer their distributions' "offical" packaging where
one exists.

Mac version
-----------
The evolvotron_061.dmg mac build of evolvotron kindly contributed
by [Forrest Walter](http://www.forrestwalter.com/)

Note that the Qt4 framework is required and must be
installed separately; try a "Framework only" install from 
[here](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads) (NB Qt is NOT QuickTime!)
