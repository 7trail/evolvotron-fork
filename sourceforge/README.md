Notes

Source tarball
--------------
Source releases are in .tar.gz files and unpack to a evolvotron/ directory.

- Note that the configure file provided is not autotools
  based, but is a script invoking qmake.

- See the evolvotron/README file build re dependencies and 
  setup of QTDIR environment 

Debian-world packages
---------------------
Prebuilt .deb packages for a variety of systems are created
to sanity-check packaging feasibility (currently using the "yada"
tool).  These are provided as they may be useful to some, but most
users should prefer their distributions' "offical" packaging where
one exists.
