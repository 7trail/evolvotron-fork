Notes

Source tarball
--------------
Source releases are in .tar.gz files and unpack to
an unversioned evolvotron/ directory.

- Note that the configure file provided is *not* autotools
  based, but is a script invoking qmake.

- See the evolvotron/README file build re build dependencies and 
  setup of QTDIR environment 

Debian-world packages
---------------------
For some (not all) releases, prebuilt .deb packages for a variety
of systems are created to sanity-check packaging feasibility
(currently using the "yada" tool).  If a release folder on SourceForge's
file hosting doesn't include .debs, look back through the immediately
preceeding releases for one.
These .debs provided as they may be useful to some, but most users 
should prefer their distributions' "offical" packaging where one 
exists.
