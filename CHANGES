From release 0.2.3:
 - Version to 0.2.4-devel
 - Get rid of troublesome system call to ../VERSION 
   in common.pro and pass settings from configure script instead
 - Add not-very-useful .qt-mng image file output format
 - Add function stats to Properties dialog
 - Add function simplification (more useful for debugging than anything)
 - Don't use True and False in doc-building python script
   (seems to be quite new thing, not in 2.1.x ?).  Use 0 and 1 instead.
 - Internal changes

From release 0.2.2:
 - Version to 0.2.3
 - Break out USAGE file from README
 - Add text_to_markup.py script to prettify USAGE file, used from configure
 - Add quick reference and user manual accessible from help menu

From release 0.2.1:
 - Version to 0.2.2
 - CPU type an option to ./configure (p3,p4,xp supported)
 - Build option for fullscreen & menu-hiding modes (from keyboard or command-line)
 - Fullscreen mode for "Big" image displays
 - Change default grid to 6x5 (would sooner have fat than thin images)

From release 0.2.0:
 - Bump version to 0.2.1
 - Display (not compute) priority to higher resolution images
   (saves time enlarging low res images unnecessarily)
 - Blank images on replacement (above change makes this more necessary)
 - Round-robin dispatch of done tasks to displays means redisplay more balanced.
 - -x and -X command line options to specify specifc top level function types.
 - FunctionKaleidoscope*, FunctionWindmill*, FunctionSeparateZ added.
 - More iterative functions also added: FunctionStreak Function*Ring
 - Added -f <frames> option to evolvotron_render
 - Internals: function framework changed (avoids FunctionNodeUsing::evaluate wrapper), speed improvement ?
 - Internals: Type of top-level node can mutate, MutatableImage more sane.
 - "Undo" keyboard accelerator works 
 - Per-image display "Properties" dialog added (placeholder)

From release 0.1.4:
 - Bump version to 0.2.0 
 - Filenames converted to/from QString using Qt's "local8Bit" codec.
 - -f option specifies number of frames (default 1, which is the non-animated behaviour of previous versions)
 - -r option specifies framerate of full-resolution animation (default 8, about the minimum to look smooth) 
 - Animations save to multiple files

From release 0.1.3:
 - Bump version to 0.1.4 
 - Function tree growth rate restored to pre-0.1.2 rates
 - Both multiscale noise types counted as iterative as originally intended.
 - "Substitute" mutation type added.
  
From release 0.1.2:
 - Bump version to 0.1.3 
 - Build lib and separate executables.  Use qmake "subdirs" at top level, move code into subdirs.
 - Add evolvotron_render executable.
 - Add evolvotron_mutate executable.
 - Better Args class.
 - Fix bug in FunctionAverageSamples
 - Add noise class
 - Add more functions.
 - Use better random number generator (MT)
 - Changes to initial setup probabilities, add chance of identity nodes front and back

From release 0.1.1:
 - Bump version to 0.1.2.  This is purely a bug-fix release.
 - Gentoo compile bug fix (Karl Robillard)
 - Disable implicit QString conversion (use explicit latin1() method).
 - Workround "C++ static initializer fiasco" by moving problem static members
   into instance-get methods.
 
From release 0.1.0:
 - Bump version to 0.1.1
 - Grid size now defaults to 7x5
 - More functions!

From release 0.0.5:
 - Bump version to 0.1.0
 - Fix nasty bug in computers where a task could be delivered and deleted while
   the compute thread was still setting state in it
   (timing related so it never happened with ccmalloc and valgrind).
 - Massive internal changes necessary for file save/load
   (also makes adding functions easier)
 - Save/load individual functions to XML
 - configure checks QTDIR defined (biggest cause of build problems)

From release 0.0.4
 - Bump version to 0.0.5
 - configure script #!/bin/* changed to sh from csh
 - Release tar files now unpack to a ./evolvotron directory
 - More "Big" size options
 - Big image can create big images
 - Big image's initial window size decided by Qt
 - Spawn warped offers more specific controls (zoom/pan/rotate)
 - Middle mouse button does stuff (pan/zoom/rotate/shear)
 - Undo menu entry describes type of action which will be undone
 - Closing a big image cleans up undo history appropriately
 - Bug with assumed EvolotronMain/MutableImageDisplay destructor order fixed.

From release 0.0.3:
 - Bump version to 0.0.4
 - More interesting start up functions
 - More functions (e.g rotation and spirals, geometric inverse, iterated fns, fractals...)
 - Controls to enable/disable expensive/ugly iterative and fractal functions (default off).
 - Fix dumb bug in xy range of image
   (makes everything generally behave a lot better; most noticeable with warp)
 - "Identity supression" control which helps eliminate/reduces obvious origin centering.
 - "Proportion constant" control (doesn't seem to have that much effect).
 - Separate reset/restart functionality (reset also resets mutation parameters).
 - Move Cool/Shield buttons to be adjacent (commonly used together).
 - "is_constant" query method used to eliminate boring constant images.
 - x&y co-ordinate alignment fixed (not something users would notice)
 - Spawn warped made less messy: just generates translate/scale/rotate... no shearing.
 - Reset clears locks / restart doesn't
 - Gratuitously templatized tuple/matrix class added to help geometric transforms.
 - Add "configure" script 'cos thats how lots of other apps do it.  Apparently.

From release 0.0.2:
 - Bump version to 0.0.3
 - Add command line arg control of grid size and threads, don't override -geometry
 - GUI control of mutation parameters
 - "Respawn" regenerates a single display area using spawn/recolour/warp as appropriate.
 - "Cancel" in file save dialog obeyed.
 - "Insert" mutation type.
 - "Undo" functionality.

From release 0.0.1:
 - Bump version to 0.0.2
 - Switch to QMainWindow base in anticipation of toolbar.
 - Save as PPM or PNG
 - Scrollable fixed-size image "Big" windows.
 - Improvements to app response under load.

From release 0.0.0:
 - Bump version to 0.0.1
 - Add volatile to inter-thread communication flags
 - Added a few more image node function types
 - Add "spawn_recoloured"
 - Add "spawn_warped"
