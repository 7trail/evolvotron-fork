INTRODUCTION
============
Evolvotron is interactive "generative art" software to evolve
images/textures/patterns through  an iterative process of random
mutation and user-selection driven evolution.  If you like lava-lamps,
and still think the Mandelbrot set is cool, this could be the software
for you.

Uses C++, STL & Qt.  Multithreaded.

If you manage to make practical use of evolvotron, especially
if evolvotron derived imagery makes it into print or other
mass media, I'd love to hear about it: please email!

Have fun

BUILDING
========
This has only been tested on RedHat8.0, but there's no reason it shouldn't
work on any platform with a correctly set up qmake (which is all the
configure step does, using the specification in evolvotron.pro).

You do NOT need to be root until the (optional) install stage.
You can either do the "traditional"

  ./configure
  make

or just have both done for you by doing

  ./BUILD

[IMPORTANT: Sorry, this version makes more use of C++ templates which in my
experience are rather prone to breaking between compiler versions.
It all compiles fine with the g++ 3.2 which comes with RedHat 8.0, but if
you get compilation errors with other versions of gcc please let me know.]

Anyway, this should give you an "evolvotron" executable which you can run with
  ./evolvotron
or install where you like.

BUILD PROBLEMS/OPTIONS
========================
Check you have your QTDIR environment defined, and possibly also your
QMAKESPEC too.  The former should point to your Qt installation.  The latter
will be something like "linux=g++" if needed; check the Qt docs for other
architectures or perhaps look in your QT installation's mkspecs directory.
(RedHat defines QTDIR for the normal user environment, and seems to work fine
without explicitly setting QMAKESPEC.  A Mandrake user reports having to set both.)

Note that qmake's default optimisation settings are pretty conservative
(-O2 -march=i386).  IF you have a chip with sse instuctions or similar, 
then I would highly recomend uncommenting and/or editing the couple of
lines modifying  QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE near the start of "evolvotron.pro"

[Other platforms: 
Linc Davis reports:
  "I built it on a Mac with Qt installed via Fink (if you know what that is.)
  All I had to do is add '$(QTDIR)/include/qt' to the include path and then
  run make."
]

INSTALL
=======
Doing
  make install
will attempt to install the executable in /usr/local/bin
(Hint: "su" first).

INSTALL PROBLEMS
================
On RedHat 8.0 the Makefile code generated by qmake bizzarely
attempts to strip the install directory rather than the target.
A Mandrake user reports nothing happens at all.
It's probably easier to just copy it yourself
(it's not like it's installing a whole load of supporting files or anything complex).

USAGE
=====
You will need a fast machine, or patience.

Command line options:
  -geometry <width>x<height> : usual Qt/X option to set on-screen size in pixels
  -g <rows> <cols> : sets number of image display cells (defaults 8 by 6)
  -t <threads> : sets number of compute threads (defaults to 2)

On starting the app, a grid of images is displayed.
(For some reason the default is quite small: you'll 
probably want to resize/fullscreen the window to be larger).

Repeat the following until bored:
 - Click (singleclick) on an image you like to 
   spawn the next generation of its mutant offspring.
 - Wait until variations on it are regenerated in sufficient 
   detail that you can decide which one you like best again.

IMPORTANT: Initially you should select images with some sort of variation.
It can take quite a few generations before you get something more interesting
than a simple gradient.  If you select a uniform image, you may get stuck
in a degenerate zone with little to mutate and therefore little chance of
escape to a more interesting area.  You can always reset/restart from the
"File" menu (the difference is that "reset" also resets the mutation
parameters to their default values).

Right clicking on an image gets you a few more options:
 - "Respawn" regenerates just the current image from whatever it was
   spawned from (and using recolour or warp, if that's what was used
   to produce it).
   The main use of this is to make your grid of images look nice
   by regenerating any which aren't up to scratch.
 - "Spawn" is the same as clicking an image.  It generates mutated
   images to all unlocked images in the grid.
 - "Recolour" to produce different coloured variants of the selected image
 - "Warp"'s sub-options produce variants of the image which have been
   zoomed/rotated/panned.
 - "Lock" to prevent an image from being overwritten by spawns from other
   images (select again to toggle).
 - "Big" to produce a blow-up of the image in a single window.
   (either a scrollable view of a fixed size image, or in a freely
   resizable window)
 - "Save" to save the image in a file (.ppm or .png format).
   Note that this is most useful on a "Big" blown-up image: if you
   save a small grid image, the size you see on the screen is the size
   you get in the file.  Note that the save won't be allowed until the
   full resolution image has been generated.

You can use the middle mouse button to drag an image around (useful
for centering the most interesting feature of an image).  It also works
on "Big" images, although it's pretty unusable.

On the application's main menu-bar, the Edit menu lets you undo
previous full-grid spawns (there is a large but limited number
of levels of undo; note that locking is overriden), and bring
up a dialog to modify the mutation parameters (see "useful tips"
and "advanced usage" below).

An area on the status bar shows how many "tasks" are outstanding.  
Each "task" is the recomputation of an image at some resolution.
Tasks are prioritised by their number of pixels  (small image =>higher
priority).  This is why, if the main grid is still recomputing, a "big" 
image  will appear to freeze after it has reached a certain resolution, 
at least until other lower resolution tasks have completed. 

Currently the software runs 2 compute threads by default so those of 
you lucky enough to have dual processor machines should see some 
benefit (or see it deadlock :^)... Be warned that I haven't had 
an opportunity to test it on more than a single processor.  

TIPS
====
- Don't start a session with any preconceived ideas about the kind
  of image you want to get out of it.  You'll be disappointed.
- I get the best results when I click the image which most
  immediately catches my eye as they start appearing.  If you stop
  to think about it too much things seem to go downhill.
- If you seem to be just getting the same old spirals all the time,
  stop clicking on spirals!

ADVANCED USAGE
==============
Evolvotron's idea of an image is a function which converts
XYZ co-ordinates to an RGB colour (however we can only display
a plane for now so the input Z is fixed to zero, although you can
get some idea of what's going on by selecting the "PanZ" option
of an image's "Warp" menu item).

The image functions are constructed from trees of function nodes.
(In the mathematical expression 1+(2*x) the "+" and the "*" would
be fuction nodes.)  Evolvotron's nodes tend to correspond to
geometric or colour-space operations or anything else which can be
applied to a 3D vector.

By mutating the structure of the function tree (including adding
random branches) and the values of the constant embedded within it, the
image can be changed.

The mutation parameters are under control from the dialog accessible via the
Edit->Mutation Parameters... menu, and also from buttons on the status bar).

There are two kinds of mutation: perturbations to the magnitude of constants, 
and structural mutations which rearrage the function tree of an image.  
Three types of structural mutations are currently implemented:
replacement of a function branch by a new random stub (a "Glitch" mutation),
a random shuffle of a node's arguments, and the insertion of random nodes
between a node and it's children.  The probability (per function node)
of these mutations is controlled from spinboxes on the dialog (expressed as 
chances-in-a-million), as is the size of perturbations from constant.

It is useful to think of the constant perturbations as being a thermal effect
(hence the "heat" and "cool" buttons), while structural alterations are
more drastic and are caused by high energy gamma rays or something
(hence "irradiate" and "shield" buttons to adjust the probability of
structual mutations). 

So why would you want to change the mutation parameters from the initial
defaults ?  Basically, if you're getting too much variation in spawned images 
(this tends to happen after many generations of images, by which time the
function trees have grown quite large and therefore are experiencing a lot
of mutations), cool and/or shield.
If all the images look too similar, heat and/or irradiate.

2 types of function node are considered fundamental: constant nodes
(which return a constant) and position nodes (which should really be
called identity nodes) which return their position argument.  There
are two slider controls to affect things realted to these:
 - "proportion constant" controls the proportion of fundamental nodes
   which are constants.  Changing this from its default value of 0.5 doesn't
   actually seem to have much effect.
 - "identity supression" causes all identity nodes to actually include a
   random transform; the main effect of this is that images are less commonly
   obviously centred on the origin or aligned with the axes.  I think this
   is a good thing, so identity supression is at 1.0 by default.

OTHER OPTIONS
=============
On the mutation parameters dialog there are tick boxes to enable two classes of
function which are disabled by default.  These are "iterative" functions and
"fractal" functions (Mandelbrot and Julia set type things).  The main reason
for their being optional is that, in the former case they're expensive, and
in the latter case they're expensive and ugly.  Note that if fractal functions
are enabled, then iterative functions are enabled too.

BUILDING CODE DOCUMENTATION
===========================
If you have doxygen (and graphviz NB!!!) and want to build
the source code documentation too, execute 
  make doc
The code documentation then appears in ./doc/html/

CLEANING UP
===========
To clean up this directory, do
  make clean
which deletes everything except the doc directory.
Do 
  make realclean
to get rid of everything including the doc directory.
