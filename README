ABOUT
=====
[This was the original "Project Purpose and Summarization" for sourceforge.]

Evolvotron
Interactive "generative art" software to evolve images/textures/patterns through 
an iterative process of random mutation and user-selection driven evolution.  
If you like lava lamps, and still think the Mandelbrot set is cool, this could 
be the software for you.

Coded using C++ and STL.  Uses Qt GUI libraries.  Multithreaded.

BUILDING
========
This has only been tested on RedHat8.0, but there's no reason it shouldn't
work on any platform with a correctly set up qmake.

You should just be able to do

  ./BUILD

(All this does is a qmake followed by a make!)

This should give you a "evolvotron" executable which you can run with
  ./evolvotron
or install where you like.

USAGE
=====
You will need a fast machine, or patience.

Command line options:
  -geometry <rows>x<cols> : usual X option to set on-screen size
  -g <rows> <cols> : sets number of image display cells (defaults 8 by 6)
  -t <threads> : sets number of compute threads (defaults to 2)

On starting the app, a grid of images is displayed.  (You'll probably want to resize it to be larger).

Repeat the following until bored:
 - Click (singleclick) on an image you like to 
   spawn the generation of its mutant offspring.
 - Wait until variations on it are regenerated in sufficient 
   detail that you can decide which one you like best again.

Right clicking on an image gets you a few more options:
 - "Spawn" is the same as clicking an image
 - "Recolour" to produce different coloured variants of the selected image
 - "Warp" to produce variants of the image with different spatial co-ordinates
 - "Lock" to prevent an image from being overwritten by spawns from other images.
 - "Big" to produce a blow-up of the image in a single window.
   (either a scrollable view of a fixed size image, or in a freely resizable window)
 - "Save" to save the image in a file (.ppm or .png format).
   Note that this is most useful on a "Big" blown-up image,
   and the save won't be allowed until the full resolution image has been generated.

IMPORTANT: Initially you should select images with some sort of variation.
If you select a uniform image, you may get stuck in a degenerate zone with 
little to mutate and therefore little chance of escape to a more interesting 
area.  You can always restart from the "File" menu.

The status bar shows how many "tasks" are outstanding.  
Each "task" is the recomputation of an image at some resolution.
Tasks are prioritised by their number of pixels (small image => higher priority).
This is why, if the main grid is still recomputing, a "big" image 
will appear to freeze after it has reached a certain resolution, 
at least until other lower resolution tasks have completed. 

Currently the software runs 2 compute threads so those of 
you lucky enough to have dual processor machines should see some 
benefit (or see it deadlock :^)... Be warned that I haven't had 
an opportunity to test on more than a single processor.  
The number of compute threads will be under command-line-option 
control at some point.

INSTALL
=======
Doing 
  make install
will attempt to install the executable in /usr/local/bin

BUILDING CODE DOCUMENTATION
===========================
If you have doxygen (and graphviz NB!!!) and want to build the documentation 
subdirectory too, execute 
  make doc
The code documentation then appears in ./doc/html/

CLEANING UP
===========
To clean up this directory, do
  make clean
which deletes everything except the doc directory.
Do 
  make realclean
to get rid of everything including the doc directory.

GRIPE
=====
I originally wanted to use gtkmm for this app 'cos Gtk looks so sexy when themed, and I'd already done
a Qt app ("fracplanet") and wanted to judge for myself how gtkmm compared.  However, I couldn't find 
any gtkmm RPMs for RedHat 8 (I did find some old ones on "freshrpms", but when I tried to use them RH's 
pkg-conf didn't seem to be set up right to actually build anything).  Sure, I could have probably 
compiled the sources, but most people aren't going to bother and so if I want to write software
people will actually download and try then it's going to have to use the libs which come with the
distros, or at least which have hassle free ready-to-go RPMs available.
Oh well, maybe next time... but Qt is really growing on me.
