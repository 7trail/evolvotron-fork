Known bugs:

  - Undo doesn't work properly for much except undoing an immediately previous Spawn
    (e.g undoing a single-image respawn undoes too much).

  - Recolour behaves strangely sometimes (?)
    (e.g spawns all-black images or subtly warped images)

  - Segv once observed on attempting to resize immediately on app startup.
    Never suceeded in reproducing this.

  - Moire patterns mean small images can show structures not actually present in larger resolution versions.
