Known bugs:

  - Undo doesn't always work how you'd expect
    (e.g undoing a single-image respawn undoes too much).

  - Undo and lock don't interact well.
    (So need to make lock a property of images, not displays).

  - Recolour behaves strangely sometimes (?)
    (e.g spawns all-black images or subtly warped images)

  - Segv once observed on attempting to resize immediately on app startup.
    Never suceeded in reproducing this.

  - Moire patterns mean small images can show structures
    not actually present in larger resolution versions.
