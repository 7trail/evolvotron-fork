Known bugs:

  - Undo doesn't always work how you'd expect
    - better than it used to be though

  - Undo and lock don't interact well.
    (Solution: make lock a property of images, not displays).

  - Recolour behaves strangely sometimes (?)
    (e.g spawns all-black images or subtly warped images)
    Not seen recently.

  - Moire patterns mean small images can show structures
    not actually present in larger resolution versions.

  - Once image colours become saturated there's not much which will cause
    them to scale back down to sensible ranges.
