Known bugs:

  - Resizing the evolvotron window queues up crazy numbers of tasks.
    This didn't matter too much in 2D mode, but with animations the memory reserved
    for each task's render target is considerably larger. 

  - Undo doesn't always work how you'd expect
    - better than it used to be though

  - Undo and lock don't interact well.
    (Solution: make lock a property of images, not displays).

  - Moire patterns mean small images can show structures
    not actually present in larger resolution versions.

  - Once image colours become saturated there's not much which will cause
    them to scale back down to sensible ranges, unless you're lucky

  - Recolour behaves strangely sometimes (?)
    (e.g spawns all-black images or subtly warped images)
    Not seen recently.
