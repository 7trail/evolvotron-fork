- More functions 
- Control grid size and number of threads from command line options.
- Control over mutation parameters (dialog box)
- Quick access "Hotter"/"Colder" control of mutation parameters
- Use hourglass cursor over displays which haven't got final high resolution yet ?
  (Need combined hourglass/pointer but Qt doesn't have one built in).
- Computing zero co-ordinate sometimes gives unusual output (black lines across images).  Avoid by jittering co-ordinate ?
  (Would break up jaggies).  Could even do super-resolution tasks for sampled anti-aliasing.
