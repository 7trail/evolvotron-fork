- Save whole grid as a single image (from File menu).
- More functions 
- Undo/Revert on Mutate menu (to recover from sloppy clicking)
- Context menu option to bring up info about an image
  (in particular number of nodes and max depth)
- Use hourglass cursor over displays which haven't got final high resolution yet ?
  (Need combined hourglass/pointer but Qt doesn't have one built in).
- Computing zero co-ordinate sometimes gives unusual output (black lines across images).
  Avoid by jittering co-ordinate (would break up jaggies), or just avoid exact zero ?
- Why stop at screen resolution ? Antialiasing by supersampling.
- Have a function type which can suck in random images from directories of images
  (specify by environmental variable ?)
- Separate tool (?) to evolve images towards a given image.
  How close would it get and how quickly ?  
  Would the process of getting there be interesting (e.g as an animation) ?
- Compute farms on multiple remote machines.
- Tasks should be a tile of an image.
- Menu options to add/remove rows/columns from display grid
- Proper progress bar based on number of pixels to be computed
- Autocool of mutation parameters
  (probably shouldn't be on by default; control from command line).
- Heat/cool etc should act in proportion to current values
  (probably wanted for autocool).
