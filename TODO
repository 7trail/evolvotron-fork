- Last method used should point to an object encapsulating the behaviour
  (so warp spawn method can encapsulate a transform factory).
  Needed for breeding behaviour (so can keep 2 last images).
- Undo needs to restore _last_spawned too (but do above first and keep hisory of spawn methods).
- Generalise "parameters" along with "args".
- Maybe add "view" menu: like warp but just applying to current image (would need explicit control over amounts).
- Add control over MutatableImageNodePositionTransformedQuadratic vs MutatableImageNodePositionTransformed proportions
  (part of rationalising all of function selection)
- Non-isotropic scaling & shear warp options.
- Command line option to enable/disable fractal and iterative types.
- Replace "Lock" with a "save" or "put-aside" window (could make history/undo simpler).
- "Unlock all" on edit menu
- More iterative functions (e.g average along a segment between two co-ordinates).
- More functions (reflection from environment, Perlin noise).
- Create registry of all function node types
  - use to bring up a panel for setting relative frequencies (check for exploding branching ratios)
  - Allow iterative/allow fractal would then become convenience buttons for quick-setting a whole group of frequencies
- Reset & Restart should bring up modal "are you sure" dialog box which can also contain check boxes for what to reset:
    mutation parameters
    function freqencies (when implemented)
    locked displays
- Quit should bring up "are you sure" dialog.
- Option to increase number of iterations of certain types of iterative node in an image (i.e "accuracy")
  (probably makes sense for Mandelbrot/Julia or a sampling blur where it just increases the detail, 
  but less useful for repeated function map).
- "Move all locked to start" on edit menu
  (or move them to a "safe area", or save them in reloadable form).
- Save whole grid as a single image (from File menu).
- Context menu option to bring up info about an image
  (in particular number of nodes and max depth)
- Reference counting for images
  (far too much deepcloning currently; e.g to tasks and history).
  But if it ain't broken don't fix it.
- Use hourglass cursor over displays which haven't got final high resolution yet ?
  (Really need combined hourglass/pointer cursor but Qt doesn't have one built in).
- Computing zero co-ordinate sometimes gives unusual output (black lines across images).
  Avoid by jittering co-ordinate (would break up jaggies), or just avoid exact zero ?
- Why stop at screen resolution ? Antialiasing by supersampling.
- Have a function type which can suck in random images from directories of images
  (specify by environmental variable ?)
- Separate tool (?) to evolve images towards a given image.
  How close would it get and how quickly ?  
  Would the process of getting there be interesting (e.g as an animation) ?
- Compute farms on multiple remote machines.
- Tasks should be a tile of an image
  (compute threads could parallelise "Big" images then).
- Menu options to add/remove rows/columns from display grid
- Autocool of mutation parameters
  (probably shouldn't be on by default; control from command line).
- Heat/cool etc should act in proportion to current values
  (probably wanted for autocool).
- Evolve other things e.g parameters of celluar automata/reaction diffusion equations/iterated function systems.
- Maybe lock status of a display should be stored in undo history too.
- Rationalise MutatableImageNode::stub so more work is done by Node constructors
  (just pass in a MutationParameters).  Have to keep existing ctor. form for deepclone though.
- Special reset which uses iterative types to set up nothing but Mandelbrot/Julia-set type functions.
- Avoid misleading moire patterns by jittering
- Combining/breeding image pairs.
  Use drag-and-drop
  Either:
    Create a new top level node with 2 or more args and add the parents to it.
    Create a new random stub and insert the parents at random points.
    Insert one image at a random point into the other.
    Concatenate the 2 images.
- Compute volumes in Z direction.
  Use time as z co-ordinate.
