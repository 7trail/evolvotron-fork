- Save whole grid as a single image (from File menu).
- More functions 
- Undo on File menu (for inaccurate clicking)
- Context menu option to regenerate a particular cell (means keeping a copy of the spawning image)
- Control grid size and number of threads from command line options.
- Control over mutation parameters (dialog box)
- Quick access "Hotter"/"Colder" control of mutation parameters
- Use hourglass cursor over displays which haven't got final high resolution yet ?
  (Need combined hourglass/pointer but Qt doesn't have one built in).
- Computing zero co-ordinate sometimes gives unusual output (black lines across images).  Avoid by jittering co-ordinate, or just avoid exact zero ?
  (Would break up jaggies).  
- Antialiasing by super-sampling.
- Have a function type which can suck in random images from directories of images (specify by environmental variable ?)
- Separate tool to evolve images towards a given image.  How close would it get ?  Would the process of getting there be interesting ?
- Compute farms on multiple remote machines.
- Tasks should be a tile of an image.
- Menu options to add/remove rows/columns from display grid
- Proper progress bar based on number of pixels to be computed
